## Meta Quest 2 connected via a cable

# Customisable
You can set package names to have nicknames on your profile instead (good if you are working on a game yourself and wish to specify its name)<br>

*Make sure you put a comma afterwards!*
(This process will be made easier in the future)

# UI
Displays the current open package/nickname (if you have one set)<br>
Progress bar for how often it is updating the current open app (Every 15 seconds else you'll be rate-limited by Discord)<br>
